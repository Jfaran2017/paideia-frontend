As you might have noticed already, you can configure your DAO voting system on Paideia as you wish, by enabling and configuring different methods of decision making such as the ‘quadratic voting’ option. The ‘quadratic voting’ method is a different method of collective decision-making, but what actually does this stand for? Let’s take a deep dive and start by introducing the basic concept of ‘quadratic voting’.

## Introducing 'quadratic voting'

The traditional voting system has relied on people expressing their agreement or disagreement with a certain vote, but what do you do when the issues at hand are so complex that you just cannot come to a consensus? Glen Weyl came up with the solution, which he called 'quadratic voting', to provide a method for making collective decisions that avoids the dominance of the majority and to allow participants to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences.

Rather than simply voting for or against an issue, participants in Quadratic Voting can also indicate the degree to which they feel strongly about it. It can help in protecting the concerns of small voter groups who have a common interest for a specific topic. Collective decision-making enabled by the blockchain, corporate governance, and the usage of Quadratic Voting are all possible applications.

### The basic concept behind 'quadratic voting'

Each voter in a Quadratic Vote is allocatted a certain number of credits to participate in the vote. However, unlike casting a single vote, the cost of casting multiple votes is quadratic rather than linear. There is a substantial increase in the fixed costs of voting with each successive vote.

### Formula for quadratic voting:

cost to the voter = (number of votes)2

Just pretend you have 100 “voting credits,” each of which can be used to cast a single vote on any issue. You wish to vote for a specific proposal. You’ll need 1 credit to cast a single vote. It will cost you 4 credits to vote twice on the same issue, 9 credits to vote three times on the same issue, and all 100 of your credits if you vote ten times on the same issue.

Thus, the quadratic nature of the voting makes sure that only those who care deeply about issues will cast additional votes for them, even though each additional vote increases the chances of having a succssfull proposal.
